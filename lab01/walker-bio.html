My name is Ellie Walker and I am currently majoring in Information Management and Technology in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse Univeristy.
I have started to concentrate my studies is both web design and digital retail strategies and I hope to expand my learning into areas of media. 
Over this past summer I worked as a Kindergarten teacher and have experience in childcare and working with childern and was a tutor last semester.
Currently I am a Peer Advisor and work in Career Services as a Career Ambassador. Outside of work, I spend majority of my time with my family and friends. 
I have a twin sister and a dog named Penny. I love to go on walks and I enjoy coffee especially from my local coffee shops. I priortize my education and I am looking forward to see where it takes me.
